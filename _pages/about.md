<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi there! I am Ruotian Wu, a Master student at University of Waterloo, supervised by <a href='[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ppoupart/)'> Profesor Pascal Poupart</a>.

I earned my Bachelor of Mathematics with a double major in Computer Science and Statistics from the University of Waterloo. During my undergraduate studies, I completed industry internships at Huawei and Manulife. My current research focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly alignment and decoding algorithms. Additionally, I am collaborating with Scribendi on AI-driven document editing. I am also exploring ways to enhance LLM agents to improve their capabilities on different game settings. I am always open to new ideas, collaborations, and industry partnerships. If you’re interested in working together, feel free to reach out!

# 🔥 News
- *2025.02: &nbsp;🎉🎉 Our latest work on RGTG is available on Arxiv and current under review for ICML2025. This work proposes a new architecture of reward models to speed up the overhead of traditional RGTG methods and came up with a new training paradigm that is more principle.
- *2024.10*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 Our work on improving RGTG is available on Arxiv. This work detailedly anylysed the all the current existing RGTG methods and improves on the ARGS method by utilizing parital-sequence preference data to train the reward model.
