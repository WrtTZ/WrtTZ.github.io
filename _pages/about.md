<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi there! I am Ruotian Wu, a Master student at University of Waterloo, supervised by <a href='[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ppoupart/)'> Profesor Pascal Poupart</a>.

I earned my Bachelor of Mathematics with a double major in Computer Science and Statistics from the University of Waterloo. During my undergraduate studies, I completed industry internships at Huawei and Manulife. My current research focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly alignment and decoding algorithms. Additionally, I am collaborating with Scribendi on AI-driven document editing. I am also exploring ways to enhance LLM agents to improve their capabilities on different game settings. I am always open to new ideas, collaborations, and industry partnerships. If you’re interested in working together, feel free to reach out!

# 🔥 News
- *2025.02*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 Our latest work on RGTG is now available on ArXiv and is currently under review for ICML 2025. This research introduces a novel reward model architecture to reduce the computational overhead of traditional RGTG methods. We also propose a new training paradigm that is more principled and efficient. \\ [Towards Cost-Effective Reward Guided Text Generation]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04517]), Ahmad Rashid <sup>*</sup>, Ruotian Wu <sup>*</sup>, Rongqi Fan, Hongliang Li, Agustinus Kristiadi, Pascal Poupart
- *2025.02*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 Our work on a new tree search algorithm is available on Arxiv and current under review for ICML2025. This work proposes an uncertainty-guided tree search algorithm for settings where the reward function is a log-likelihood function of the paths. \\ [Uncertainty-Guided Optimization on Large Language Model Search Trees]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03951]), Julia Grosse, Ruotian Wu, Ahmad Rashid, Philipp Hennig, Pascal Poupart, Agustinus Kristiadi
- *2024.10*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 Our research on improving RGTG is now published on ArXiv. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of existing RGTG methods and enhances the ARGS method by leveraging partial-sequence preference data to train more effective reward models. \\ [A Critical Look At Tokenwise Reward-Guided Text Generation]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07780]), Ahmad Rashid, Ruotian Wu, Julia Grosse, Agustinus Kristiadi, Pascal Poupart
